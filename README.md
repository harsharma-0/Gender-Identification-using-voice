# Gender Classification Using Voice

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the use of a Random Forest Classifier for gender classification based on voice features. The script uses the scikit-learn library to perform classification and generate Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.

## Introduction

This script uses the Random Forest Classifier to predict the gender of individuals based on voice features. It reads the data from a CSV file (`voice.csv`), preprocesses it, trains the classifier, and plots the ROC curves for evaluation. The goal is to demonstrate how to use machine learning techniques for binary classification tasks.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the `voice.csv` file containing the voice features dataset in the same directory as the script.

2. You can download the voice.csv file from voice.csv(# https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-qG8qYyR_7DouXvDDMk-u2umCJzLdYai?usp=sharing)

3. The script will output the ROC curves for each fold of the cross-validation, as well as the mean ROC curve.
